This is my first post. People usually use the first to talk about what they will post. - _"Which topics should my posts follow?_". Did you expect me to do a different approach?

I know for sure that I'm not going to talk about politics or religion. This blog intends to be a boring place where a bald guy (yes, It's me) writes about programming, machines, electronics, traveling, music, food and some personal experiences.

over and out

Peace!
