# Introduction. The challenge

If you are reading this post, you may probably know what is my job.

Before moving to the previous one, tons of  doubts came to my mind. The main one was: "Will I feel myself motivated enough in that project?"

When choosing a job, motivation is one of the most important considerations to take into account. Unfortunately, this is not an objective factor and it depends on the person.

Let's start reading the definition of **challenge**.

> Challenge. (the situation of being faced with) something that needs great mental or physical effort in order to be done successfully and therefore tests a person's ability. ([Cambridge dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/challenge))

Did you notice that the definition of challenge could perfectly become in motivation in some cases?

We could even analyze how many people consider the challenge as something important when they are changing their job, but I'm pretty sure that most of them have it in the top list of considerations.

But how can a company offer professional challenges for every employee? Is this possible?

I strongly believe that keeping your employees motivated (and [self-motivated](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/self-motivated)) is a success factor where it becomes a win-win situation between the employee and the company. Hard to do at the same time but still a win-win.

I detailed a list of the important factors **I consider** every company should have in mind to succeed in the employee's motivation.

*   Analyse hard and soft skills of your employee **individually**.
*   **Trainings**. A great budget dedicated to people's training is a must.
*   Do not assume you know the limits. Sometimes people's expertise is **greater** than you thought.
*   Avoid searching talent from outside as first decision. Try to **promote** your internal talented team first.
*   Let people **rotate** position and roles as far as make sense with the business model.
*   **Listen** to your employees. Junior people, senior people. It does not matter. They usually have great ideas but nobody listen to them. Remember they work with the product every day.
*   Be **transparent** and give feedbacks asap in every situation. The company culture should be transparent-oriented.
*   Tell your employees what do you expect from them. **Listen** what they expect from the company and take actions.

# Climax. The challenge of getting a new challenge.

After reading the title and the introduction you may deduce this is the reason why I'm leaving SP.

I have been working there for 3 years aproximately. It was not in a row, because I lived 1 year in London (That is another story, probably for another post).

Social Point made me grow professionally in a really fast way .I learnt high traffic web systems and when I say high I mean HIGH! traffic :-), concurrency, caching, infrastructure in the cloud, automation and orchestration, security and a really long list. Apart from that, now I can say I know the internals of a videogame. Who can do that? :-)

I left Social Point because I was waiting for a new challenge. I'm not saying I hadn't any (in fact I encourage you to check their [opened positions](http://www.socialpoint.es/jobs/) right now and apply), but I wanted just a different one like learning different technologies, or even being lead in a new project.

# Revelation. A new challenge.

I actually did not expect to jump to another company for the moment. But probably this attitude made me decide to do it.

I found a really interesting opportunity in ExoClick that brings me a challenge divided in three parts.

The **first one** is to be part of a spin-off which needs to deal with high-traffic batching system and big data challenges.

The **second one** is related to the role position. I have a path full of opportunities to learn and improve. I will be in charge of taking the technical architectural decisions and managing people at the same team. That is something I really appreciate.

And **last** but not least, the team of the project.

I can't say too much right now because it's quite confidential, but I hope I can write another post in the future revealing some internals of my new job. Specially how happy I will be then.

Thanks for reading.

PD: Thanks [Ferran](http://twitter.com/ferranorriols) for your text revision.
